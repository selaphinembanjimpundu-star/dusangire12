   customer_phone = delivery_address_obj.phone
   delivery_instructions = delivery_address_obj.delivery_instructions
   delivery_charge = delivery_address_obj.get_delivery_charge()
   
   # Get special requests from form
   special_requests = request.POST.get('special_requests', '').strip()
   ```

3. **Order Creation**:
   ```python
   order = Order.objects.create(
       user=request.user,
       customer_name=customer_name,
       customer_phone=customer_phone,
